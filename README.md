# MatthewHarperOloPizzaAssessment

Simple windows forms application to demonstrate the use of c#, json, and linq.  Build and run the project and you are all set.

Click the button and you should see the top 20 most popular pizza orders along with their subtotals and a list of their ingredients.

Pardon the UI.  If I need something to look nice, I typically use Telerik.

Thank you.
